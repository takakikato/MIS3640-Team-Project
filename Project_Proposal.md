# Project Proposal

### 1. The Big Idea:
Main Idea:
- Allow users to find recipes by inputting available ingredients.

Minimum Viable Product:
- Website that allows users to input ingredients and receive a recipe based on what ingredients they have. 
- Allows users to filter recipes.
- Recipes include text and pictures.

Stretch Goal: 
- Allow users to scan their food receipts instead of inputting manually.
- Allow users to rate recipes and sort by rating. 
- Create an app.
- Store and manage user data on specific amounts of ingredients to suggest later recipes. 

### 2. Learning Goals:
- Learn how to scrape the web and clean the data.
- Learn how to create, manage, filter, and index databases.
- Implement and design website/app

### 3. Implementation Plan:
Library and framework:
- Web Scraping -> Beautiful Soup, Selenium 
- Database -> Pandas

General Plan:
1. Scrape the websites for recipes
2. Clean the data and form database
3. Write program
4. Implement it in web format

### 4. Project schedule: 

Meet weekly Tuesday after class for the first 4 weeks and Tuesday and Thursday after class for the last 4 weeks. There is a possibility of changes in this schedule depending on the progress.

Week 1: 
- Brainstorm of what outside resources and information/datas we need. 
- Find websites that contain recipes and start learning how to scrape the web. 
- Assign individual research on cooking websites and methods.

Week 2:
- Decide which website to use and start scraping
- Evaluate feasibility

Week 3:

------------------------------------ Spring Break --------------------------------------------

Week 4: 
- Clean the data to make it usable and start creating databases

Week 5:
- Start coding a program that allows users to create inputs

Week 6: 
- Integrate database and the program

Week 7:
- Create code for filtering system and reviewing rest of the code

Week 8:
- Implement it in website format

Week 9:
- General bug fixes and polishing

Week 10:
- Finish & Polish up 

### 5. Collaboration plan: 
- Weekly meeting as a group to discuss progress and work on potential problems
- Assign tasks and work independently
- Pair program when needed and to collaborate and to help each other

### 6. Risks: 
The largest risks that could possibly stand in the way of this project would be web scraping and data rights of the websites we get the data from. Companies nowadays are very sensitive to how their data is collected and used. If our web scraping tool needs to be approved by the company there may not be enough time to complete the project.

### 7. Additional Course Content: 
1. Web scraping
2. Database management
